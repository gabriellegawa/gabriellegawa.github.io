    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Hi, welcome to my portfolio page where I will display all activities and projects.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My full name is Gabriel Nathan Legawa, but my nickname is Nathan. I love programming, video games, and breaking
        things. I enjoy solving problems and I believe if we can think about it we can do it. I am currently working as a Software Developer at Scotiabank. Click <a href="https://github.com/gabriellegawa">here</a> to navigate my Github repositories.
